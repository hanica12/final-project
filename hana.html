						<h3>Who is this beautiful person?</h3>
						<p>It is Hana!! I was born and raised in Sarajevo, capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I lived there for a very very long period, 24 years to be exact. One year ago I moved to Prague and joined our <b>lovely CULS</b>. Logically, you can conclude that I am <b>25 years</b> old, in my opinion young (and beutiful).
							I love many people, animals and things in life. Since I follow many <b>furry animals</b> on the internet, you will have great opportunity to get tho know them as well. <b>Exciting, right?</b> Besides those fluffs, I enjoy reading science blogs, listening music and traveling as much as possible.

								<h3>Topi the corgi</h3>
								<p>Corgies are very cute because of their <b>tiny legs</b> and nice <b>furry</b> coat. They have unproportionaly <b>big ears</b> and they look silly. Also, they are a bit <b>fat</b>. That's why I like them. This is one of the <b>cutest</b>, </b>Topi the Corgi.</b></p>

								<h3>Hosico the cat</h3>
								<p>On the home page you had a chance to meet Nala and White Coffee cat. Besides them, I also love Hello Luna Rose cat which is their young sister. This is my 4th favorite cat - Hosico. <b>Hosico</b> lives in <b>Russia</b>, it is a <b>fluffy boy</b>. He likes to sleep and sit into boxes.</p>
