								<h3>Things that Vera likes to do in free time...</h3>
								<p>I have many hobbies,but I always start from my favourite which is for sure <b>PAINTING</b>. I've been painting since I was a kid, and I was attending different painting courses. I like to play basketball, to travel a lot, to meet new cultures, new people. If you are interested in painting/drawing, and you live in Prague, I truly suggest you to <a href="https://www.drawplanet.cz/en/about-us/"> visit Draw Planet Studio</a></p>
